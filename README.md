#RainDesign
Originally a final project for a class, the goal is to make a functional IDE for the Rainmeter engine. Comprised of two key components - 

1) A parsing system to parse existing/generated Rainmeter files into memory, along with recognizing and mapping dependencies
2) A GUI component to display files in a manageable and easily understood view, with the ability to edit files easily

Development is on hold due to classes and things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Also some of the existing components need some big refactoring. And design decisions need to be made on how to handle files with things that are bad/incorrect practice but still totally work.
